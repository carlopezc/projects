# 🚀 My Project Portfolio

Welcome! My training at 42 Barcelona is intensely project-based. This portfolio is structured to give you a high-level overview of the skills I've developed.

I've categorized my projects by the core computer science concepts I've mastered. The detailed technical explanations for each project are located in the `README.md` of their respective repositories.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Mastered

* **Foundational C & Memory:** Building core libraries, managing memory manually, and handling data structures from scratch (e.g., `Libft`, `Get Next Line`).
* **Algorithms & Optimization:** Solving complex logic puzzles and optimizing sorting algorithms with minimal resources (e.g., `Push Swap`).
* **System & Process Management:** Understanding UNIX processes, file descriptors, inter-process communication (IPC), and parsing (e.g., `Pipex`, `MiniShell`).
* **Concurrency & Multithreading:** Managing race conditions, deadlocks, and shared resources using threads and mutexes (e.g., `Philosophers`).
* **Graphics Programming:** Rendering 3D wireframes, managing graphical windows, and handling keyboard events (e.g., `FdF`).
* **System Administration & Security:** Configuring, securing, and managing a Debian server in a virtualized environment (e.g., `Born2BeRoot`).
